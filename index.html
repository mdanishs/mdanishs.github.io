  Hi there! ðŸ‘‹<br />
</p>
<p>
  I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of fun creating cool tech stuff. I've worked in different areas, making services and products better. I love new challenges and learning every day. Excited to share this journey with you!</p>
<p>
  My current passion project is <a href="https://discus.live">https://discus.live</a>, a mentorship platform that connects aspiring entreprenuers and software professionals with mentors so they can build a network and accelerate their careers.

  My expertise lies in creating web and cross-platform mobile apps that are not only functional but also user-friendly and engaging. I am always open to new opportunities and would love to connect and see how we can work together to build something great!
